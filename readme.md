# spetsura.com — my personal terminal-style resume website

This is my personal portfolio site, styled as a terminal interface. It reflects my background, mindset, and attitude toward technology. Everything is handcrafted: from HTML/CSS to animations and layout logic.

## 🔍 What's inside

- Terminal-like intro animation
- `whoami` section — personal summary as a CLI command
- Work experience with tab navigation
- Responsive design for mobile (burger menu included)
- Light/dark theme support (/resume page)
- Downloadable PDF resume via `/resume`

## 🛠 Built with

- Pure HTML, CSS, vanilla JS
- WebStorm + SFTP for deployment
- GitHub for version control
- Oracle Cloud VPS + Nginx + systemd
- Cloudflare for DNS and HTTPS

## 🧠 Why I built this

To demonstrate not just "tech experience", but how I work:

- Clean, minimal, framework-free architecture
- No templates — built and deployed entirely by me
- Full control over logic, layout, and hosting
