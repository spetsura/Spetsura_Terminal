**Bohdan Kyianytsia**

**System Administrator**

## Summary

System administrator with 5 years of hands-on experience supporting Linux/Windows infrastructure, networks, and cloud platforms. Skilled in building stable, well-documented systems under pressure — from office relocations to blackouts during wartime. Combine automation, reliability, and attention to detail. Technical background in engineering helps me think in systems, not fragments.

## Core Skills

* **Operating Systems:** Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Windows Server, macOS  
* **Networking:** MikroTik (MTCNA), Ubiquiti UniFi, VLANs, VPN, port forwarding, firewall configuration  
* **Infrastructure:** Nginx, Apache, systemd, DNS, SSL, Cloudflare, Nextcloud  
* **Cloud & Self-Hosting:** manual VPS deployments (Oracle Cloud, AWS, Google Cloud), static site architecture, backup automation strategies  
* **Scripting & Tools:** Bash, UFW, crontab, basic automation routines  
* **Monitoring & Reliability:** service uptime tracking, diagnostics and recovery  
* **Hardware:** PC/workstation/server assembly, diagnostics, modular repairs, component-level troubleshooting  

## Experience

**Natus Vincere (Sep 2020 – Present)**  

* Supported and maintained IT infrastructure across multiple offices (~200 endpoints) in a high-demand esports environment  
* Led full IT operations for office relocation: deployed internal LAN/Wi-Fi stack using MikroTik and UniFi systems  
* Administered Windows Server and Linux-based services (Ubuntu, CentOS)  
* Delivered daily L1-L2 support across systems, resolving hardware/network/software incidents under tight timeframes  
* Configured and maintained cloud services (AWS, Cloudflare, Google Workspace)  
* Integrated new hardware and software systems, managed equipment lifecycle from procurement to deployment  

## Key Infrastructure Projects

* Planned and delivered full IT support for 50+ internal bootcamps and 20+ live events — including temporary networking, systems prep, redundancy planning, and on-call response — all with near-zero tech downtime  
* Implemented automated backup system for sensitive Windows Server data to SFTP storage (content under NDA)  
* Reduced downtime to zero during power outages by integrating EcoFlow battery systems for critical IT infrastructure — ensuring continuity even during missile strikes and emergency blackouts  
* Identified power fluctuation risks and initiated the installation of voltage stabilizers for non-UPS equipment  
* Participated in early-stage IT infrastructure planning for new office location  
* Collaborated with contractors on indoor LED display system deployment (Novastar); learned control stack and took over post-install maintenance; automated remote control of display systems using Wake-on-LAN and Anydesk; configured content delivery and playback via SuperNova auto-launch  

## Hardware & Systems Insight

* Confident in component-level diagnostics, PC and workstation assembly, modular repair and maintenance  
* Deep understanding of system stability, thermal considerations, and hardware-related bottlenecks  
* Applied low-level hardware knowledge to design more reliable IT setups and predict failure points  
* Comfortable troubleshooting hardware issues in real-time during production and live events  

## Technical Background – Engineering Foundations

Before transitioning fully into IT, I worked in civil infrastructure, focusing on inspections and reporting for bridges and special structures. During this period, I regularly produced formal technical documentation, drawings, and structured reports based on engineering assessments. This early experience helped develop my attention to detail, accuracy, and ability to maintain long-term project documentation — skills I now apply directly in IT environments.

## Education

**National Transport University, Kyiv**  

* Master's Degree in Civil Engineering (2018–2019), Graduated with honors  
* Specialized in structural systems and technical documentation  
* Bachelor's Degree in Construction Technology (2014–2018)  

## Certifications

* MTCNA — MikroTik Certified Network Associate  
* Pre-MTCNA — MikroTik UA  

## Project

**spetsura.com — Personal Self-Hosted Terminal-Style Website**  

* Designed and built a terminal-inspired personal website from scratch using plain HTML/CSS/JS  
* Self-managed on Oracle Cloud (Ubuntu VPS) with Nginx, secured via Cloudflare (DNS + SSL + firewall)  
* Implemented scroll-triggered animations via IntersectionObserver, fully responsive layout  
* Structured the entire project manually: versioning, cache busting, favicon optimization, minimal JS  
* Maintained directly via Git and WebStorm, deployed over SFTP  
* Page "/notes" documents the entire infrastructure and reasoning step-by-step (like a live README)
